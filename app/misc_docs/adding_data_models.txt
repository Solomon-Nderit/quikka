1. New Model Creation Pattern
Following your current pattern, you'd create:

Appointment model in models.py
Foreign key relationships to existing tables
Same SQLModel approach you're using
2. Relationship Strategy
Based on your current User â†” Stylist pattern, appointments would likely:

Belong to a Stylist: stylist_id foreign key to Stylist table
Optionally belong to a Customer: customer_id foreign key (if you add Customer model later)
Manual foreign key management (like you're doing now, not SQLModel relationships)
